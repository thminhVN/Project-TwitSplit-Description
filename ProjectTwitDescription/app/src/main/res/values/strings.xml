    <string name="template_message">We want to see how you create a new project and what technologies you decide to you use. A good project will be cleanly structured, will only contain the dependencies it needs, and will be well-documented and well-tested. What matters is not the technologies you use, but the reasons for your decisions. Bonus points will be given for demonstrating knowledge of modern Java/Kotlin techniques and best practices.</string>
